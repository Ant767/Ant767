I am the absolute worst developer, but im just trying to have some fun

If you find my things useful, you should join my Discord server at [https://discord.gg/leafessentials](https://discord.gg/leafessentials)

Languages:
- Go (not very well)
- Rust (currently learning a bit, dont really like using it tho)
- Javascript
- Typescript

I also know Svelte, its the best frontend framework. If you think React is better you need to get checked

btw the reason my name here is ant767 is because this was an alt that slowly turned into my main account and i cant change the name

Minecraft Java Account: InternetCatOwO
Minecraft Bedrock Account: Trash9240/AnUwUFurry (im active on both idk why)
